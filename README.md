# Practical Statistics for Data Scientists
___
This is a follow along of Peter and Andrew Bruce's Book "*Practical Statistics for Data Scientists*" as I try to learn more about the world of Data Science.

I have been working with Python quite a bit, and strangely enough I am finding how much I actually hate working with Python to the point where I prefer Scala and dare I even say Java... pause for gasp... more than Python. Maybe it is the lack of structure or the fact I have seen so many poor examples of Python implementations, or it's terrible speed with Spark UDFs, but I can't stand it anymore. 

Luckily this book has examples in R. My original "programming" (I am saying that loosely) language, which made me fall in love with general data analysis and even my first dive into data science with a linear regression model that predicted fuel burn for 767 aircraft fleet. I am excited to get to play around in R, again.

```r
greet <- function(name) {
    print(paste0("Hello, ", name, "!"))
}

greet("Your Name Here")
```
> "Hello, Your Name Here!"
